## ü§ñ IACC (Intelligent Artificial Call Center)  
Proof-of-concept project integrating multiple AI technologies to simulate an intelligent outbound call center. It performs real-time calls, interacts with customers, understands their responses, and replies using natural voice synthesis ‚Äî all in a fully automated flow.

### Features  
- **Outbound Call Bot Flow**  
  1. **Call Handling**: Uses Twilio to initiate real phone calls and manage live audio streams.  
  2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts predefined scripts and AI-generated responses into natural-sounding voice via ElevenLabs.  
  3. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Transcribes customer speech in real time using OpenAI Whisper.  
  4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyzes customer intent and generates dynamic responses with OpenAI GPT-4-turbo.  
  5. **Conversational Loop**: Continuously listens, processes, and replies to maintain a natural conversation flow.

- **Modular Backend**  
  Built with FastAPI (Python) for high performance, scalability, and easy integration with AI and telecom services.

## Technologies Used
### Core AI Tools
- NLP: OpenAI GPT-4-turbo
- TTS: ElevenLabs
- STT: OpenAI Whisper

### Telephony
- Twilio: Outbound call initiation and media handling

### Backend
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI: API framework
- Uvicorn: ASGI server

## Setup
### Managing Python Virtual Environments (for macOS users)
> üí° **Note:** These commands also work on most Linux distributions. This section is labeled for macOS users because, in macOS, using virtual environments is strongly recommended‚Äîand often necessary‚Äîwhen working with Python projects such as FastAPI backends, to prevent conflicts with the system‚Äôs Python and to manage dependencies cleanly.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Windows users are not included here because the setup commands differ significantly. If you're using Windows, consider following a platform-specific guide or using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for a more consistent Unix-like development experience.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (you can change 'aienv' to any name)
python3 -m venv ~/venvs/aienv

# Activate the virtual environment
source ~/venvs/aienv/bin/activate

# To list all virtual environments
ls ~/venvs

# To check installed packages in current env
ls ~/venvs/aienv/bin

# To deactivate when finished
deactivate
   ```
### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn openai twilio
# You can add others as needed, for example:
pip install python-dotenv requests
   ```
Don‚Äôt forget to install the SDKs for the services you're using (e.g., openai, twilio, etc.).

## Run the Project
```bash
# From the root of your project
uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
Make sure the file where your FastAPI app is declared is called main.py, or modify the command accordingly.

## Future Improvements
- **First considerations (high priority)**
  - CRM integration: Connect with tools like Make or Zapier to send data to a Google Sheets document as a CRM prototype, facilitating lead tracking and management.
  - Outbound call infrastructure: Optimize integration with Twilio and its webhooks to efficiently manage the call flow and real-time responses.
  - Call and transcription logging: Store conversations in text format to enable post-call analysis, error detection, and continuous improvement of the conversational model.

- **Second considerations (medium priority)**
  - Advanced conversational flow management: Implement robust logic to handle conversational states (start, interaction, end) and maintain contextually coherent responses based on the user‚Äôs intent.
  - Error and interruption handling: Design strategies to allow the bot to recover if the user says something unexpected, remains silent, or deviates from the conversation.
  - Latency optimization: Reduce response times between conversation turns by improving performance in the STT ‚Üí NLP ‚Üí TTS pipeline, ensuring a smooth and natural call experience.
